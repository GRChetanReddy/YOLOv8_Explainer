## Features and Functionality

`YOLOv8-Explainer`  can be used to deploy various different CAM models for cutting-edge XAI methodologies in `YOLOv8` for images:

- GradCAM : Weight the 2D activations by the average gradient
- GradCAM + + : Like GradCAM but uses second order gradients
- XGradCAM : Like GradCAM but scale the gradients by the normalized activations
- EigenCAM : Takes the first principle component of the 2D Activations (no class discrimination, but seems to give great results)
- HiResCAM : Like GradCAM but element-wise multiply the activations with the gradients; provably guaranteed faithfulness for certain models
- LayerCAM : Spatially weight the activations by positive gradients. Works better especially in lower layers
- EigenGradCAM : Like EigenCAM but with class discrimination: First principle component of Activations*Grad. Looks like GradCAM, but cleaner


# Using from code as a library

```python

from YOLOv8_Explainer import yolov8_heatmap, display_images

model = yolov8_heatmap(
    weight="/content/drive/MyDrive/object detection dataset/axial_t1wce_2_class/runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt", conf_threshold=0.4, renormalize=False,
)

imagelist = model(
    img_path="/content/drive/MyDrive/object detection dataset/axial_t1wce_2_class/images/test/00022_83.jpg", 
    )

display_images(imagelist)

```

You can choose between:

`GradCAM` , `HiResCAM`, `GradCAMPlusPlus`, `XGradCAM` , `LayerCAM`, `EigenGradCAM` and `EigenCAM`.
